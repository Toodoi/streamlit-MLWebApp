# Data Science Web App using Streamlit
This is a very simple web app I made as a fun project to test out Streamlit. Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to quickly turn Python scripts into interactive applications. It is great for data science applications to visualise the data and allow interactability with charts and models.

I used a data set from Kaggle with the problem of predicting rain in Australia and built a random forest model as the predictor. I used Plotly to visualise the data on the app and deployed it using Heroku. You can take a look at the app [here](https://rain-prediction-webapp.herokuapp.com/).
